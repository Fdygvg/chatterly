all of these are in the .env file and can be imported
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=jackcollmas@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=
EMAIL_FROM=Chatterlly <jackcollmas@gmail.com>

so all of that is in the env file we are going to drop the google auth and instead impleent the following 

welcom message upon signup 
email security message upon every login 
forgot passsword logic
